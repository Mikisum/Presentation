    |Electron combines Chromium and Node.js with a set of custom APIs for native operating system functions 
    |like open file dialogs, notifications, icons and more. Developing with Electron is like building web pages 
    |that we can seamlessly use Node inâ€”or building a Node app in which we can build an interface with HTML and CSS. 
    |And we only need to design for one browser, the latest Chrome.
